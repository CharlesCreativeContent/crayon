## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Crayon seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us through GitHub's Security Advisory "Report a Vulnerability" tab.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead:
1. Go to the "Security" tab of this repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the form with a description of the vulnerability

We will respond as quickly as possible to your report and work with you to verify and address the issue.

Thank you for helping keep Crayon and its users safe!
